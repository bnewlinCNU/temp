      <h2> Cool Dachshund Facts:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Dachshunds were origninally bred to hunt Badgers!</li>
          <p>"Dachshund" is actually german for "Badger Dog", because their short legs would help them track scents into tight holes other dogs could not</p>
          <li>Dachshunds come in various coat lengths and styles!</li>
          <p></p>
          <li>For a brief time, Dachshunds were called "Badger Dogs"!</li>
          <p>This was during WWII, where any association with Germany was taboo in the US.</p>
          <p>This led to a momentary rebranding of the dogs, which obviously didn't stick around long</p>
